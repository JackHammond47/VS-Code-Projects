                Even if you have all the books, bells, and whistles to start your very first game of Dungeons and Dragons, you need other people to play with.
                Finding a group can be scary, uncomfortable, and really challenging.
                The good news is that you're not alone.

                    The people you choose to play with can make DnD a great experience or one that is awkward and uncomfortable.
                    For this reason, it is important to take time to find the right group for you.
                    In addition to the materials below, there is also a forum link for more information if you want.

                        The original way of playing the game is sitting down at a table together and laughing while eating chips and salsa. 
                        For those interested in a face to face scenario, playing in person is the way to go. 
                        There are a few different ways to get the ball rolling. First you can start asking your friends, or if your friends are the reason you are here- you're in luck! 
                        Secondly, any local tabletop game stores almost always have game nights and you can ask to join. 
                        Lastly, you can check local facebook groups or even post on the "looking for group (r/lfg)" subreddit.

                        Playing online started out as a way for people to meet together over long distances, but with COVID it quickly became a huge part of the game.
                        Online can be a great alternative to traditional groups no matter what circumstance you are in, and it is easy to get started with tools such as 
                        <a class="link_paragraph" href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> or even just meeting up on 
                        <a class="link_paragraph" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. 
                        Finding a group online can be even easier with great tools such as D&D Beyond forums or the Looking for Group subreddit r/lfg.

                        Dungeons and Dragons can be a scary experience, so there is nothing wrong with wanting to be prepared before you start playing. 
                        There are a number of great YouTube channels that make videos to help new players, such as 
                        <a class="link_paragraph" href="https://www.youtube.com/@XPtoLevel3">XP to Level 3</a> or Critical Role's

                        Additionally if you are having any sort of problems at your table, you should always feel comfortable talking to your DM or even asking for help online. 
                        The subreddit 
                        <a class="link_paragraph" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/">DM Academy</a> is a great place for anybody to ask for advice on the game.
